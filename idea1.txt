We can create phone application using Rewards API.
The application UI can be designed using Sencha Touch/Phone Gap/ Ionic Framework.
All three frameworks can be implemented as mobile first application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on what application will do which is not already implemented on rewards API side.
2. connecting the Models of the application towards the API to fetach the data.
3. Implement controller to connect model with view.
4. Implement view. (HTML | CSS3 (Material) | Angular 1x)



Idea 2:
We can also work on voice activated Payments using Alexa API and Capital One API.
Problem with this is voice recognition. Also most people have automated payments setup but urgent or immediate 
payments can be controlled by this. 

We can do some brainstorming during the first hour and then agree on what is feasible and what can be implemented.

Idea 3: 
Integrate a voice activated Travel Itinerary application (viewtrip.travelport.com) which can view 
an itinerary and report your rewards values for the air carriers.  Secondly it can, socialize a 
trip list, letting the user pick a trip list and socialize a set of excusion opportnities and the 
ask if the user would like to view Credit Card offers to help fund their vacation.  It would email 
a link to a web responsive application that we would write that would provide a list of credit offerings.

The first part of the idea would be our main goal and the second part would be our stretch goal.

All driven from Alexa as the voice activation driver.
